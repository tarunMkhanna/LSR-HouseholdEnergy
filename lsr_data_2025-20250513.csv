Information interventions using social comparisons have proven generally effective at improving conservation behaviors, yet are largely suboptimal and sometimes fail when not adequately designed for their specific context. Environmental managers and policy makers need guidance on behavioral intervention design to maximize effectiveness. This article reports the results of a randomized control trial field experiment that used social comparisons to influence individual electricity conservation behaviors in a unique experimental setting with homogeneous residential units and no economic incentive for subjects to conserve. Two treatment groups receiving information feedback with different social comparison reference points exhibited an average treatment effect of 6 % relative to a control group that did not receive feedback. Moreover, treated subjects whose baseline behavior was more proximate to their relevant comparison group norm exhibited stronger response to the treatment (greater than 10 %) than treated subjects whose baseline behavior was more distant from the relevant norm. These results demonstrate that individuals may be more responsive to social norms when provided with a relevant norm that is more proximate to their baseline behavior.

The research was conducted using Randomized Control Trials, which implied defining a treatment and control group on a sample of 330 households. The research was carried out in Republic of Serbia, where electricity prices are the lowest in Europe and electricity is used inefficiently. For quantitative analysis of data, the Difference in Difference method was used, which compares the changes in electricity consumption over time between the treatment and control group and estimates the overall impact of the energy saving instructions. The research showed that in situations where electricity price is very low, energy saving information does not have the significant impact on change in consumer behavior. However, inefficient use of electricity might be due to the different efficiency of heating devices used.

We apply synthetic control methods to derive a suitable control group.

Using data from 38 natural field experiments, we isolate the role of technology adoption by comparing treatment and control homes after the initial resident moves, which discontinues the treatment for a home. We find that the majority of energy reductions persist in the home after treatment ends and show this persistence is consonant with a technology adoption channel.

Despite the current data limitations, our results do seem to suggest that uniformly applied norm-based interventions may have potentially backfiring effects in small-scale implementations. Therefore, they suggest that attention needs to be paid to household composition and pre-existing levels of consumption, when designing behavior-change interventions in these groups.",2021,"NA","NA","13",4,"Random effects regression","Weekly Average Electricity","Difference in Difference",0.0476,-1,0.00852,"standard error",NA,"NA","Authors mention a limitation of the study is access to quality baseline data",NA,41.664,6,NA,41.832,6,NA,12,NA,"uncertainty measures available",NA,NA,"actual","t-test",5.5868544600939,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1,NA,NA,"Smaller than municipality",NA,NA,"Bolzano",NA,"Italy","Individual Household - RCT","Yes","yes","Yes","Probably Yes","Probably No",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"23-163",0.849885533330502,NA,NA,3.22557192645847,1.25574046403885,0.00701038908110784,7.25904e-05,0.00701038908110784,0.76684642719821,0.111111111111111,"No","Yes","No","Yes","Yes","Yes","Yes","No","No",NA,"Yes","No","No","No","Yes","No","No","No","1","2","3","2","3","household",NA,NA,NA,NA,1,NA,"0","Europe excl.

Recent research has begun to explore how behavioral insights can influence behavior in the world, at scale. work often involves field experiments studying outcomes over short time windows. We study a descriprive social norms intervention‟s impact on household energy usage continuously over 39 to 49months. Our two field experiments (N=155,000 households) each have three conditions: control, continued treatment, and treatment that is subsequently discontinued. We find that continued treatment reduces energy usage over the entire period (“durability”). Further, after treatment is discontinued, a sizable energy use reduction persists (“persistence”). Finally, continued treatment generates a greater impact over time than discontinued treatment, showing that continued treatment exerts incremental influence on behavior over and above persistence.

We study a descriprive social norms intervention‟s impact on household energy usage continuously over 39 to 49months. Our two field experiments (N=155,000 households) each have three conditions: control, continued treatment, and treatment that is subsequently discontinued.

However, for occupants in a shared space, who have no or split financial incentives, it remainsunclear whether normative feedback is effective in encouraging them to conserve energy. To fill thisresearch gap, this study presented a field experiment to test the energy-saving effect of normative feed[1]back in shared spaces contextualized in shared dorms. Difference-in-Differences analysis was used toexamine its effectiveness. The results showed that normative feedback in the form of multi-level refer[1]ence groups had a significant positive effect on occupants’ behavior change and energy savings in sharedspaces, with energy savings of 7.73%. Detailed normative feedback can increase the efficacy of normativefeedback in shared contexts, as it provides multi-level feedback with social comparative references.Besides, the effect of normative feedback significantly differed depending on group characteristics (i.e.,genders, grades, kinds of users). Normative feedback exhibited a higher energy-saving rate for malegroups than female groups. However, most of the male groups whose baseline energy is similar to thatof females increased their energy consumption after receiving normative feedback. For males and femaleswith the same baseline energy consumption level, motivating the male group to conserve energy is morechallenging. Sending normative feedback to newcomers works better. The element of the injunctive mes[1]sage of normative feedback can partially eliminate the boomerang effect. Moreover, the effectiveness ofnormative feedback is affected by the duration of messaging, and its positive effect on behavioral changehas a time lag of three weeks. However, the energy-saving effect of normative feedback only lasted untilthe intervention was discontinued. These conclusions provide insights into conserving energy in sharedspaces by providing norm-based interventions.",2023,"NA","NA","7",1,"OLS regression","electricity consumption","Difference in Difference",0.9595,-1,0.3243,"standard deviation",NA,"NA","Baseline mentioned as being collected, but not explicitly provided in the paper",NA,NA,60,NA,NA,60,NA,120,NA,"uncertainty measures available",NA,0.003,"actual","t-test",2.95868023435091,"NA",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,"Smaller than municipality",NA,NA,"Zhuhai",NA,"China","Individual Household","NA","yes","Yes","Probably Yes","Probably Yes",NA,"14","5","November 2nd, 2020 to February 7th, 2020","yes","Energy (kWh)","message","NA",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,"0",0,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"23-184",0.260746220239483,NA,NA,0.540178634932888,0.266908895620443,0.00729954004889085,0.10517049,0.00729954004889085,0.0345491373234915,0.00854700854700855,"Yes","No","No","Yes","Yes","Yes","No","Yes",NA,"No","Yes","No","No","No","Yes","No","No","No","3","1","3","2","3","household",0,0,0,0,1,0,"0","Asia","OLS","DID",1,"NA","14","Yes","After",1,"Macro",103,"high"

"23-199-1","Luke","Andor, MA; Gerster, A; Peters, J; Peters, J; Schmidt, CM; Schmidt, CM","Peer-Reviewed Paper",2020,"Social Norms and Energy Conservation Beyond the US","The seminal studies by Allcott and Mullainathan (2010), Allcott (2011), and Allcott and Rogers (2014) show that social comparison-based home energy reports (HER) are a cost-effective climate policy intervention in the US. Our paper demonstrates the context-dependency of this result. In most industrialized countries, average electricity consumption and carbon intensity are well below US levels.

By using a randomized experiment, we find that the availability of descriptive hourly electricity information provided on web portals reduces electricity consumption by about 8.6%.

Starting in April 2002, the utility replaced prepayment meters with advanced meters that allow the consumer to track usage in real-time. We rely on this event, account for the endogeneity of price and payment plan with consumption through a plan selection correction term, and find that the provision of information is associated with a decline in electricity consumption of 11–17%.

We find that conservation effects differ considerably between both utilities, ranging from a precisely estimated zero effect to −1.4%.

Despite their growing diffusion, fed by the large-scale smart meter roll-out currently ongoing in many energy systems, rigorous studies providing evidence on their effects are still missing, especially for the long-term. We address this research gap by analysing a one-year long app-based electricity saving intervention performed in Switzerland between 2018 and 2019, involving 55 self-selected households. Adopting a quasi-experimental approach and considering four full years of energy consumption data, we estimate the app's average treatment effect over time and perform heterogeneity analyses on household sub-groups, on varying their characteristics and intensity of app use. The app reduced consumption and CO2 emissions during the intervention (average treatment effect on the treated equal to 4.95%, statistically significant at the 0.05 level; Cohen's d effect size equal to 0.35). However, one year later the effect disappeared. Our results put policies based on persuasive app use into perspective: taken in isolation, persuasive apps may exhibit limitations regarding long-lasting effects. To avoid relapse, future interventions might embed app use into broader processes explicitly aimed at redefining shared norms and conventions on household energy consumption practices, for instance within living lab processes. © 2023 The Author(s)",2024,NA,NA,"7",1,"Household Fixed effects","electricity consumption","Difference in Difference",0.0508,-1,0.0253,"standard error","Effect after one year","17.123000000000001","Baseline determined from visual interpretation of a provided box and whisker plot - open to error",0.296676984173334,NA,82,NA,NA,55,NA,137,0,"uncertainty measures available",NA,0.04662,"actual","t-test",2.00790513833992,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,"Smaller than municipality",NA,NA,"Contone",NA,"Switzerland","Stratified Random Assignment","Yes","yes","Yes","Probably yes","Probably yes",NA,"208","52","June 1, 2018 to May 31, 2019",NA,"Energy (kWh)","App","continuous (on-demand)",0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,"0",1,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"23-327",0.169077122002973,NA,NA,0.343093826181909,0.170716473818554,0.00693855201752689,0.00064009,0.00693855201752689,0.0308065509854616,0.00746268656716418,"Yes","No","No","Yes","Yes","Yes","Yes","Yes","Yes","No","Yes","Yes","No","No","No","No","No","No","3","2","3","3","2","randomised",0,0,0,0,0,1,"0","Europe excl.

Inefficiently overused amounts of electricity can be reduced through low-cost feedback and nudges. We chose to frame different messages to alter the electricity usage behavior of students while residing in their dorm rooms at the Prince of Songkla University during the second semester of 2016. The messages used are descriptive and injunctive social norms information. The two-way fixed effects regression analysis indicates that reporting the dorm room's electricity usage and peer-comparison jointly with signs of social approval (injunctive social norms via emoticons) can effectively save electricity by 3.63%, with statistical significance at 0.1 level. We confirm that the “boomerang effect” occurs when reporting peer-comparison without injunctive social norms. No evidence proposes that students feel socially responsible for their electricity-induced CO2 emissions. Also, small-group peer-comparison cannot influence electricity conservation. Our results benefit universities in Thailand and our low-cost method is applicable to other tertiary education institutions in Southeast Asian economies that share similar social norms, especially on perceived wealth and the low interest in sustainability. © 2023 Elsevier Inc.",2023,NA,NA,NA,1,"Household Fixed effects","electricity consumption","Control-treatment",0.0363,-1,0.0218,"standard error",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,167,NA,NA,167,NA,1013,NA,"uncertainty measures available",NA,NA,NA,"t-test",1.6651376146789,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,"Smaller than municipality",NA,NA,"Songkhla",NA,"Thailand",NA,"No","yes","Yes","Probably yes","Probably yes",NA,"16","16","Data collected from January - April 2017",NA,"Energy (kWh)","Reports","monthly",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"0",0,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"23-338",0.0522458581251984,NA,NA,0.10463462071983,0.0522934734146857,0.000982755129936536,0.00047524,0.000982755129936536,0.0119924377303191,0.00099009900990099,"Yes","No","No",NA,"No","Yes","No","Yes","Yes","No","Yes","No","No","No","No","No","No","No","3","1","3","2","2","randomised",0,0,0,0,1,0,"0","Asia","PanelEffects","Control-treatment",1,NA,"16","Yes","After",0,"Macro",217,"high"

"23-471-1","Anaïs","Harold, Jason","Unpublished Academic Paper",2018,"Heterogeneity and persistence in the effect of demand side magement stimuli on residential gas consumption","Feedback on residential energy consumption has long been identified as an effective demand side magement (DSM) instrument to encourage household energy conservation. This paper explores the heterogeneous treatment effects of a DSM program on residential gas consumption across different groups of households categorised by their socio-economic and household characteristics. The program was employed in Ireland's Smart Metering Gas Consumer Behavioural Trial and the demand stimuli tested consisted of informatiol feedback on a household's gas usage.

While energy coaches are widely employed, evidence on the effectiveness of energy coaches and their approach is lacking. We collaborated with a housing cooperation that trains and provides tools for energy coaches in the Netherlands, comparing the electricity and gas consumption of households before the visit of a local energy coach and their consumption 1 year later.

We conducted randomized controlled trials to evaluate the impact of push notifications with energy efficiency advice. The proposed energy efficiency advice used the data of electricity consumption and attributes as well as behavioral science’s ‘‘nudge” approach. The results indicate that the energy efficiency advice reduced electricity consumption by 1.3%, which is statistically significant. Furthermore, the implementation rates had increased for some of the energy-efficiency behaviors that were mentioned in the advice. Additionally, the opening ratios of the push notifications were improved 1.2 and 1.3 times using personalized sentences and adjusting the timing of the push notifications, respectively. These results indicated that personalization of the push notifications could increase the number of users who check the advice. An increase in the energy efficiency rate was observed among households who checked the advice on the standby screen of the smartphone and the dialog and notification list screen in the app. Although this study used relatively simple logic to deliver personalized energy efficiency advice, the results suggest that utilizing smartphones and various data, as well as making communication more interactive between the users and service providers, could effectively induce energy-efficient behavior.",2020,"NA","NA","5",1,"OLS regression","electric consumption kWh","Difference in Difference",NA,-1,NA,"standard error",NA,"21.9",NA,1.3,22.9,854,0.332,21.9,845,0.33,1699,1,"uncertainty measures available",0.331006813980605,0.01,"actual","t-test",16.99,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,"Utility Area",NA,"Kanto region of Japan, including the Tokyo metropolitan area",NA,NA,"Japan","Individual Household - RCT","Yes","yes","Yes","Probably Yes","Probably Yes","Lack of data reported regarding the regression analysis performed on the initial, pre-split treatment group","82.72","21.86","prior to treatment is April 2017 to June 2018. treatment period from July 2nd, 2018 to December 2nd, 2018",NA,"Energy (kWh)","smart phone app","continuous (on-demand)",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,"0",1,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"11/10/2023",NA,"23-195",0.381085407356151,NA,NA,0.824378553820998,0.401328854624174,0.000430293546024137,NA,0.000430293546024137,0.00255439214001635,0.000589622641509434,"Yes","No","No","Yes","Yes","Yes","No","Yes","Yes","Yes","Yes","Yes","No","No","Yes","No","No","No","3","1","3","3","3","household",0,0,0,1,1,0,"1","Asia","OLS","DID",1,"21.9","82.72","Yes","After",0,"Minor",272,"high"

Unfortunately, research indicates that almost 41% of this power is wasted. Changing the way that consumers use energy may be important in reducing home energy consumption. This paper looks at whether the implementation of certain real-time energy monitors has an impact on the residential rate of energy consumption in a metropolitan area with relatively low electricity rates. In the following case study, 151 Omaha residences were equipped with two variants of the Aztech In-Home Display (Aztech) as well as the Blue Line Power Cost Monitor (PCM) real-time energy monitors for a period of 16 months. The results of the data, 30 days after installation, revealed a statistically insignificant reduction of 12% in mean electrical consumption in houses equipped with a PCM and no reduction in mean consumption in homes using either variants of the Aztech device when compared to a randomly selected control sample. However, they proved effective in the short term if utilized by utilities for mass distribution to foster awareness among participating residents of their own patterns of residential electricity consumption and on the environmental impacts of energy saving.",2012,NA,NA,"2009",1,"Difference of means","Percent change in electricity consumption","Control-treatment",NA,-1,NA,"-999",NA,NA,NA,12,-999,95,NA,NA,51,NA,146,12,NA,NA,NA,"3","t-test",0.684,"2",NA,NA,"Data on standard errors not available.

"23-207-1",NA,"Allcott, H",NA,2011,"Rethinking real-time electricity pricing","Most US consumers are charged a near-constant retail price for electricity, despite substantial hourly variation in the wholesale market price. This paper evaluates the first program to expose residential consumers to hourly real-time pricing (RIP). I find that enrolled households are statistically significantly price elastic and that consumers responded by conserving energy during peak hours, but remarkably did not increase average consumption during off-peak times. The program increased consumer surplus by $10 per household per year. While this is only one to two percent of electricity costs, it illustrates a potential additional benefit from investment in retail Smart Grid applications, including the advanced electricity meters required to observe a household's hourly consumption.

information on occupant behavior. The newest type of feedback, “real-time” or continuous
energy use monitoring, has become popular through its application in educational and
professional settings. This paper investigates whether continuous feedback is effective in a
residential setting, and explores the effects of socioeconomic status and household characteristics
on conservation practices and energy use consciousness. Ten households were randomly invited
from a 60-household survey to receive a digital electricity monitor called The Energy Detective.
Drawing on surveys, utility bill records, and semi-structured interviews with these households,
we discuss the effectiveness of the monitor in each household. We conclude that the monitors
have a greater effect on energy consciousness than on conservation behavior in both high-income

Insights from a behavioural economics pilot field experiment in Copenhagen, Denmark","This paper examines the relationship between loss aversion and consumer behaviour in a non-price policy intervention that followed the installation of smart meter (SM) technology. Drawing upon insights from behavioural economics, we propose that consumers underestimate potential gains and overestimate potential financial losses resulting from electricity use. To test the hypothesis, we carried out a pilot study involving the installation of SM technology in Copenhagen, Denmark. The analysis used two baselines, and the differential effects revealed that the provision of loss-framed, salient information reduced daily demand by 7-11%, compared to unframed information. Reductions in standby consumption were more pronounced, with a differential effect of 16-25%. Despite the limitations inherent in a pilot study, notably the small sample size, the findings suggest that policies that address SM technology need to consider not only the pure provision of information, but also how it is designed and presented to users. Several aspects for further research are identified.",2017,NA,NA,"73",1,"Difference of means","Avg daily electricity consumption (kWh)","Control-treatment",NA,-1,NA,"-999",NA,NA,NA,NA,4.75,5,0.65,5,11,1.09,16,0.24,NA,0.984559365,0.25,"1","t-test",1.17,"1",NA,NA,"baseline is smart meters.

Participants (with the exception of the control group) received feedback in various forms, i.e. consumption compared to previous consumption or to similar others; energy saving tips in leaflets or on a computer; or feedback relating to financial or environmental costs. Respondents were interviewed after the start of the study to establish their income, socio-demographic status, environmental attitudes and the extent to which they already engaged in conserving activities. Participants also took part in focus groups after the final meter readings were taken. Overall the results indicated that income and demographic features predicted historic energy consumption but not changes in consumption during the field study, where environmental attitudes and feedback were influential. Of all the feedback groups, the installation of computers helped reduce consumption most markedly. Furthermore, people with positive environmental attitudes, but who had not previously been engaged in many conservation actions, were more likely to change their consumption subsequent to the feedback period. Recommendations are made both for energy conservation policy and future research.

The improved consumption feedback provided, and in particular, the installation of in-house displays, has been shown to significantly reduce residential electricity demand in some international trials. This paper attempts to uncover the underlying drivers of such information-led reductions by exploring two research questions. First, does feedback improve a household's stock of information about potential energy reducing behaviours? And second, do improvements in such information help explain the demand reductions associated with the introduction of smart metering and time-of-use tariffs? Data is from a randomised controlled smart metering trial (Ireland) which also collected extensive information on household attitudes towards energy conservation and self-reported stocks of information related to energy saving. As with previous results in Ireland, we find that participation in a smart metering programme with time-of-use tariffs significantly reduces demand. Although treated households also increased their selfreported energy-reducing information, such improvements are not correlated with demand reductions in the short-run. Given this result, it is possible that feedback and other information provided in the context of smart metering are mainly effective in reducing and shifting demand because they act as a reminder and motivator.

The research to date has a number of limitations: 1) it has not de-coupled the impact of the norm and the knowledge required to understand how to change behavior based upon it; and 2) it has not understood the impact of social norms under different incentive structures. We address these limitations using two natural field experiments. We find, firstly, that norms change energy consumption irrespective of whether information is provided or not. We find that social norms reduce consumption by around 6% (0.2 standard deviations). Secondly, we find that large financial rewards for targeted consumption reductions work very well in reducing consumption, with a 8% reduction (0.35 standard deviations) in energy consumption. The effect persists even when the financial incentive has been removed, suggesting no crowding out of financial incentives. Perhaps most interestingly, we find that the large effect of financial incentives completely disappears when information on social norms is included.

In this paper, I evaluate how low-income households in a major Colombian city respond to this policy. Using hourly household electricity consumption data, I find that, on average, households reduce electricity consumption by 4.5% as a result of the policy. It is striking that even low-income households, who consume relatively small amounts of electricity, respond to energy-saving policies and engage in conservation behaviors in the short term. In my analysis, I also find that the effect is stronger the higher the household pre-treatment electricity consumption levels and smaller among poorer households. However, the heterogeneity in terms of income level vanishes once I control for household pre-program electricity consumption levels.

"23-235-1",NA,"Erell, E; Portnov, BA; Assif, M",NA,2018,"Modifying behaviour to save energy at home is harder than we think ...","A 2-year study was carried out in a sample of 120 apartments in two cities in Israel, Jerusalem and Nesher, in which different strategies to influence energy consumption were tested using an interventional case-control design. Socio-demographic attributes of individual households were recorded and building thermal performance was evaluated by detailed computer simulation. Attitudes of the study participants to environmental issues were assessed to identify potential motivations for energy savings. Although yearon-year energy consumption increased for exogenous reasons in all test groups, in Jerusalem the increase in the maximum intervention group (which received detailed information on energy consumption patterns over time, and individually tailored energy-saving tips) was 2.5%, compared to 9.5% in the reference group, which received only generic energy saving tips. The difference among groups in Nesher was not significant. A multivariate analysis confirmed that the attempt to influence apartment occupants' behaviour failed to generate a statistically significant reduction in domestic energy consumption. The study underlines the importance of controlling for endogenous factors, such as weather and building thermal performance, while evaluating the effectiveness of different intervention strategies, to avoid potentially wrong inferences about the effectiveness of such strategies. We conclude that effective behaviour modification may require repeated implementation of a broad range of tools over a sustained period of time. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

electric water heaters and thermostats, commercial building space conditioning, municipal water pump
loads, and several distributed generators were coordinated to manage constrained feeder electrical
distribution through the two-way communication of load status and electric price signals. The field
demonstration took place in Washington and Oregon and was paid for by the U.S. Department of Energy
and several northwest utilities. Price is found to be an effective control signal for managing transmission
or distribution congestion. Real-time signals at 5-minute intervals are shown to shift controlled load in

One community was Alice Springs, a town with about 9000 households in the geographic centre of Australia. The programme offered a package of support: free energy audits, discounts for the purchase of renewable energy technology and energy efficiency measures, and ongoing information. Households that adopted solar hot water and photovoltaic systems reduced their electricity usage immediately after adoption by 10% and 34% respectively, and this was maintained in the long term. A small rebound effect of 15% was observed in the photovoltaic adopters. It was observed that, on average, households that adopted only energy efficiency measures did not have a significant reduction in their electricity usage over the long term. However, consistent with expectations, this study did show that there was a significant correlation between the number of energy efficiency measures adopted and the greatest household reduction in electricity usage. These contrary results indicate that there are additional factors involved. The connection between the effective use of measures, coincident behavioural change or increased energy awareness and greater energy reduction is discussed. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Much research in many different fields, including behavioral sciences, economics and sociology, has been carried out to understand and possibly influence domestic energy consumption patterns. In this paper we conduct a field experiment of an online application, jointly developed with Dutch energy utility Greenchoice. During one month, a sample of customers was requested to record and submit the readouts of their electricity meter. These readouts were then converted to easily comprehensible information that was fed back to the customer. Performance was also compared to a control group which did not receive any feedback and served as a baseline. The results suggest that feedback through the web application does indeed increase perceived consumer awareness and reduces electricity consumption. Experimental groups consumed on average 6-7 percentage-points less electricity compared to the control group.",2012,NA,NA,"8",1,"Difference of means","Daily average electricity use/expected daily electricityuse","Difference in Difference",0.063,-1,NA,"-999",NA,NA,NA,7.429245283,0.848,94,NA,0.785,320,NA,414,0.063,NA,NA,NA,"1","t-test",2.277,"1",NA,NA,"The statistical analysis is quite poor.",NA,NA,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,"country","Netherlands",NA,NA,NA,"Netherlands","household level",NA,"Yes","Yes",NA,NA,NA,"4","4",NA,"no","Energy (kWh)","webportal","continuous (on-demand)",0,0,0,NA,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,NA,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,NA,NA,NA,"single",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"23-252",0.132389818698583,NA,0.267130997105094,0.267130997105094,0.133171524195083,0.00233717450311309,NA,0.00233717450311309,0.0138494802027926,0.0024330900243309,"Yes","No","No","No","Yes","No","Yes","No","Yes","No","Yes","Yes","Yes","Yes","No","Yes","Yes","No","3","3","3","3","3","household",0,0,0,0,0,0,"0","Europe excl.

"23-254-1",NA,"Henry, ML; Ferraro, PJ; Kontoleon, A",NA,2019,"The behavioural effect of electronic home energy reports: Evidence from a randomised field trial in the United States","Behavioural interventions, such as informational nudges, have become an increasingly popular strategy in demand-side energy management. In particular, home energy reports (HERs) have been used to induce behavioural change among residential consumers. These HERS typically provide peer comparisons of energy use and information about energy savings opportunities.

The panel data of hourly electric power consumption among 50 households (including 22 control households and 28 treated households) were collected from a baseline survey (14 days before the dynamic pricing experiment was conducted) and during the 14-day experimental period. Propensity score analysis with local linear matching was employed to analyze the average treatment effects of dynamic pricing on consumer behavior.

The our goal was to see how much additional electricity savings could be induced using feedback beyond average savings achieved by goal-setting and to provide students information on how to conserve. Design/methodology/approach - All participants set goals related to personal environmental behavior and received electricity-saving tips. Half of the participants were exposed to real-time, group-level, ambient and direct feedback of electric use for their dormitory floor through an iPad display. The control group received no feedback. Findings - The group that received the real-time feedback reduced its consumption, whereas the control group did not. The feedback group's change in consumption was significantly greater than the control group's. The results are discussed in the context of injunctive norms, reminders, ambient feedback and numerical feedback, as well as the theory of planned behavior. Research limitations/implications - Further research could test for long-term effects, whether the interventions applied in this study would be effective in other university contexts and whether the interventions would influence other environmental habits apart from electricity consumption on campuses. Originality/value - This is one of the first energy feedback studies to demonstrate the effectiveness of group-level data, let alone specifically in a college dormitory and has implications for influencing conservation behavior of residential college students worldwide.",2016,NA,NA,"11",1,"Difference of means","Reduction in daily electricity consumption","Difference in Difference",NA,-1,NA,"-999",NA,NA,NA,10.4,-1.97,62,2.72,0.78,66,1.99,128,2.75,NA,2.37,NA,"1","t-test",NA,"1",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,"Dormitory","Vermont, USA",NA,NA,"Vermont","USA","Floor level randomisation",NA,"Yes","Yes",NA,NA,NA,"7","4",NA,"no","NA","inhomedisplay","continuous (on-demand)",0,0,0,NA,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,NA,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,NA,NA,NA,"single",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"23-262",0.501827324121111,1.16033755274262,NA,1.16033755274262,0.551745553055304,0.00440753823996887,NA,0.00440753823996887,0.036539856926395,0.008,"Yes","No","No","Yes","Yes","No","Yes","No","Yes","Yes","Yes","Yes","Yes","Yes","No","Yes","Yes","No","3","2","3","3","3","group",0,0,0,0,0,0,"0","North America","MeansDifferences","DID",1,NA,"7","Yes","After",1,"Minor",467,"high"

Results of a field study in Southern France","The abundant literature on consumer feedback shows that it is an efficient instrument for reducing household energy consumption. However, the reported reductions are strongly dependent on contextual factors and on the type of feedback provided. Given the importance of learning to this respect, this dimension constitutes the core focus of the present study which reports the findings of the TICELEC (i.e. French acronym for information technologies for responsible electricity consumption) project in France. The experiment included a control group (G1: the self-monitoring group) and one equipped group (G2). All participants reduced their consumption and learnt either directly from feedback or indirectly through self-monitoring. The amount of energy savings, which is larger than in similar experiments, can be explained by two factors. First, the specificity of our sample (i.e. high income, high consumption) which allows for potentially large energy savings. Second, high involvement of participants and the building of trust. The quantitative and qualitative dimensions of learning are then discussed. Additionally, we focus on peak-load shifting in G2 with 2 subgroups (G21 and G22). The higher proportion of shifters in G22 and the higher 'quality' of their shifting suggest a higher level of learning enabled by the more sophisticated feedback. Although this translated into only a moderately higher rate of energy savings, the higher degree of absorbed knowledge (i.e. through 'learning by looking through connecting') might lead to a qualitatively distinctive type of energy saving.",2017,NA,NA,"601",1,"OLS regression","Change in Annual Electricity Consumption","Difference in Difference",1606.543,-1,NA,"not provided",NA,"21000",NA,7.650204762,NA,35,NA,NA,30,NA,65,NA,NA,NA,0.1,"1","t-test",1.668636,"2",NA,NA,"It's a field study, not an experiment; Actually, it can be coded.

The findings are as follows. First, the Smart Grid project effectively causes a reduction in electricity use. Second, households which have the following characteristics tend to use more electricity: male householder, many family members, income. Third, households which have better understanding about the Smart Grid use less electricity. Based on these findings, we can derive the following policy implications. First, it is necessary to set up a policy which accelerates active participation of both consumers and producers of related equipment in order to promote the Smart Grid. Second, a reform of the electricity pricing system is needed to enhance the effectiveness of the Smart Grid project. Third, publicity activities of the Smart Grid project should be strengthened for wider recognition. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

We present the example of Velix, a web portal designed to motivate customers of a utility company to reduce their electricity consumption. In particular, we consider the effectiveness of goal setting functionality and defaults in influencing energy conservation behavior. For this purpose, we use the web portal as a test of the theoretical propositions underlying its design. Based on data collected from a field experiment with 1,791 electricity consumers, we test hypotheses regarding the structural relations between defaults and goals, the impact of defaults and goals on consumption behavior, and the moderating role of feedback on goal choice. Our results confirm the positive impact of goal setting on energy conservation. We show that default goals lead to statistically significant savings by affecting goal choice. However, if the default goals are set too low or too high with respect to a self-set goal, the defaults will detrimentally affect behavior. We also show that feedback on goal attainment moderates the effect of default goals on goal choice. The results extend the knowledge on goal setting and defaults and have implications for the design of effective energy feedback systems. The study's approach, which combines hypothesis-driven work and design-oriented IS research, could serve as a blueprint for further research endeavors of this kind, particularly with regard to feedback systems based on future smart metering infrastructures.",2013,NA,NA,"1323",1,"ANOVA","% change","Difference in Difference",NA,-1,NA,"-999",NA,"5643",NA,13.31605223,4.09,927,NA,1.79,864,NA,1791,2.3,NA,NA,0.01,"1","F-test",7.23,"2",NA,NA,"Recoded  on the 6th of October 2020",NA,NA,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,"Country",",,Austria",NA,NA,",","Austria","household level",NA,"Yes","Yes",NA,NA,NA,"46","18",NA,"no","Energy (kWh)","webportal","weekly",0,0,0,NA,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,NA,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,NA,NA,NA,"single",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"23-270",0.0634474686064397,NA,0.127151123889506,0.127151123889506,0.0635328124838379,0.000554170414949414,NA,0.000554170414949414,0.00224066957329498,0.000559284116331096,"Yes","No","Yes","Yes","Yes","Yes","No","Yes","Yes","No","No","No","No","No","No","No","No","No","1","1","1","1","1","household",0,0,0,0,0,0,"0","Europe excl.

However, if the default goals are set too low or too high with respect to a self-set goal, the defaults will detrimentally affect behavior.

"23-273-1",NA,"Ma, GF; Lin, J; Li, N",NA,2018,"Longitudinal assessment of the behavior-changing effect of app-based eco-feedback in residential buildings","Eco-feedback as an approach to intervene in energy consumption behavior and encourage energy conservation has achieved considerable success in recent decades. Conclusions about the performance of eco-feedback systems in the literature were mostly drawn based on their short-term performance, during which eco-feedback information was continuously provided. This study, by gradually removing eco-feedback system functions in different phases of an experiment, examines the durability of the behavior-changing effect of eco-feedback under different conditions. The eco-feedback information is delivered using mobile app, which provides a higher level of accessibility than other eco-feedback technologies. A prototype app-based eco-feedback system was developed in this study, and used in an experiment that was carried out in student dormitories. The experiment lasted for fifty-three weeks, and it included four phases, during which the level of functionality of the eco-feedback system varied. The experiment results demonstrated the effectiveness of using mobile app for delivering eco-feedback information. Longitudinal analysis of the results found that the behavior-changing effect of eco-feedback changed over time. The effect was significantly positive in the short term, then became slightly positive in the medium term, and further faded to an insignificant level in the long term. Moreover, analysis of individual participants' energy consumption profiles revealed that their behavior changes were highly sensitive and responsive to whether and how eco-feedback information was delivered. This study advances the knowledge about app-based eco-feedback and its effect in reshaping the energy consumption behaviors of occupants in dormitory buildings over time. Future research can be done to further validate the generalizability of the findings to other types of residential buildings or eco-feedback systems using different technologies, so as to provide important implication and guidance for implementing eco-feedback in practice.

"23-273-2",NA,"Ma, GF; Lin, J; Li, N",NA,2018,"Longitudinal assessment of the behavior-changing effect of app-based eco-feedback in residential buildings","Eco-feedback as an approach to intervene in energy consumption behavior and encourage energy conservation has achieved considerable success in recent decades. Conclusions about the performance of eco-feedback systems in the literature were mostly drawn based on their short-term performance, during which eco-feedback information was continuously provided. This study, by gradually removing eco-feedback system functions in different phases of an experiment, examines the durability of the behavior-changing effect of eco-feedback under different conditions. The eco-feedback information is delivered using mobile app, which provides a higher level of accessibility than other eco-feedback technologies. A prototype app-based eco-feedback system was developed in this study, and used in an experiment that was carried out in student dormitories. The experiment lasted for fifty-three weeks, and it included four phases, during which the level of functionality of the eco-feedback system varied. The experiment results demonstrated the effectiveness of using mobile app for delivering eco-feedback information. Longitudinal analysis of the results found that the behavior-changing effect of eco-feedback changed over time. The effect was significantly positive in the short term, then became slightly positive in the medium term, and further faded to an insignificant level in the long term. Moreover, analysis of individual participants' energy consumption profiles revealed that their behavior changes were highly sensitive and responsive to whether and how eco-feedback information was delivered. This study advances the knowledge about app-based eco-feedback and its effect in reshaping the energy consumption behaviors of occupants in dormitory buildings over time. Future research can be done to further validate the generalizability of the findings to other types of residential buildings or eco-feedback systems using different technologies, so as to provide important implication and guidance for implementing eco-feedback in practice.

Thus, promoting residents' electricity saving has become an important way to achieve energy conservation and emission reduction targets in China. Although goal setting has proven effective in motivating households to save electricity, little is known about how to use feedback to motivate families to achieve challenging power-saving goals. We conducted an 18-week randomized controlled field trial in Xuzhou, Jiangsu Province, China, to explore what kind of feedback measures can encourage urban residents to save electricity when given a challenging power-saving goal. The experiment included 4 experimental groups and 1 control group. The four experimental groups were given the same 15% power-saving goal in the first 14 weeks and received contrast feedback. Different types of feedback content (self-contrast and others-contrast) and different feedback frequencies (once a week and twice a week) were used. After 14 weeks, the contrast feedback stopped, and we observed whether the power-saving behavior was sustainable only in the target situation. We collected household electricity consumption data from the power supply company's metering system, and we performed an analysis of covariance to control the influence of residents' existing electricity consumption habits. The results revealed four key findings. (1) Setting the 15% power-saving goal and providing others-contrast feedback (OCF) effectively promoted urban residents' power savings. The goal and OCF groups saved 14.45% and 11.86%, respectively. (2) Regarding the feedback content, the power-saving effect was significantly stronger in the OCF groups than in the self-contrast feedback (SCF) groups. (3) An increase in the feedback frequency from once a week to twice a week did not substantially affect residents' electricity-saving behaviors.

Thus, promoting residents' electricity saving has become an important way to achieve energy conservation and emission reduction targets in China. Although goal setting has proven effective in motivating households to save electricity, little is known about how to use feedback to motivate families to achieve challenging power-saving goals. We conducted an 18-week randomized controlled field trial in Xuzhou, Jiangsu Province, China, to explore what kind of feedback measures can encourage urban residents to save electricity when given a challenging power-saving goal. The experiment included 4 experimental groups and 1 control group. The four experimental groups were given the same 15% power-saving goal in the first 14 weeks and received contrast feedback. Different types of feedback content (self-contrast and others-contrast) and different feedback frequencies (once a week and twice a week) were used. After 14 weeks, the contrast feedback stopped, and we observed whether the power-saving behavior was sustainable only in the target situation. We collected household electricity consumption data from the power supply company's metering system, and we performed an analysis of covariance to control the influence of residents' existing electricity consumption habits. The results revealed four key findings. (1) Setting the 15% power-saving goal and providing others-contrast feedback (OCF) effectively promoted urban residents' power savings. The goal and OCF groups saved 14.45% and 11.86%, respectively. (2) Regarding the feedback content, the power-saving effect was significantly stronger in the OCF groups than in the self-contrast feedback (SCF) groups.

Second, we found a positive influence of treatment externalities across time and households on energy saving.

"23-280-4",NA,"Mizobuchi, K; Takeuchi, K",NA,2013,"The influences of financial and non-financial factors on energy-saving behaviour: A field experiment in Japan","This study examines the influences of financial and non-financial factors on electricity-conservation behaviour. A random sample of 236 Japanese households participated in the field experiment and the participants were offered two interventions, such as monetary rewards, depending on their reduction in electricity consumption and comparative feedback. The average saving rates of the (i) reward-intervention group (5.9%) and the (ii) reward with comparative feedback group (8.2%) are statistically larger than those of the (iii) control group (1.7%). Our study demonstrates the following. First, our econometric analysis confirmed a significant response by households to financial incentives but a more inconclusive response to the treatment that provided non-financial, additional information. Second, we found a positive influence of treatment externalities across time and households on energy saving. Third, there is a heterogeneous treatment effect in the reward-intervention group, with the households having a high New Ecological Paradigm (NEP) score being more likely to respond to the reward programme and save electricity than those that do not. Finally, and most interestingly, differences in responses to the questionnaire before and after the experiment suggest that the participants had underestimated the marginal costs of saving electricity before they actually started to do so.

Based on the investigation results, the authors also discuss the policy implications of demand management to shift consumption to days that have more solar radiation, while at the same time reducing overall consumption. The dynamic pricing experiment was implemented on Nushima Island, located in the center of Japan, with the participation of 50 households. The methodologies used in this study are panel analysis with random effects, and the difference in differences method. Several linear regression analyses are performed to predict hourly electricity usage from a number of explanatory variables, such as life-style factors, the frequency of access to the visualization website, control for weather factors (wind speed and temperatures), and other attributes of the households to predict the log of hourly electric energy consumption. The results show that dynamic pricing brought about 13.8% reduction of electric energy consumption in comparison with the pre-experiment period. Also, by applying a new experimental design approach, this study finds data supportive of habit formation by participants.

This paper will evaluate the energy-saving potential of improving consumer behavior on the basis of a field study. In the original survey plan, the monthly electricity use of households in three typical residential buildings In the city of Hangzhou, China, were monitored from April 2007 to July 2008. A total of 124 households in those buildings were selected as the subject households. Half of them were informed of 34 energy-saving measures before July 2008 to teach them how to improve their behavior and control electric appliances in their daily lives. Finally, a questionnaire survey was administered in the beginning of August 2008 to identify the changes in the occupants' behavior. Based on the comparison analyses among the differences in the electricity uses of the 71 remaining valid samples, the conclusions can be drawn that: (1) residential electricity use will increase continually in the near future in China due to improved standards of living and a greater dependency on electric appliances, and (2) more than 10% of household electricity use can be conserved by Informing occupants of energy-saving measures to improve their behavior.",2009,NA,NA,"-999",1,"Difference of means","Household energy consumption during the experiment","Pre-test/post-test",NA,-1,NA,"-999",NA,"6097",NA,1.182876825,-999,0,NA,NA,45,NA,45,72.12,NA,36.51089092,NA,"1","t-test",NA,"1",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,"City",", Hangzhou, China",NA,NA,"Hangzhou","China","no",NA,"No","Yes",NA,NA,NA,"8","4",NA,"no","NA","homevisit","NA",0,0,0,NA,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,NA,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,NA,NA,NA,"single",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"23-287",0.702699886114383,1.97530101793528,NA,1.97530101793528,0.872614162735494,0.00582389704111707,NA,0.00582389704111707,0.0661211895080898,0.0238095238095238,"Yes","No","Yes","Yes","Yes","Yes","Yes","Yes","Yes","No","No","Yes","No","No","Yes","No","No","No","1","2","1","2","2","not randomised",0,0,0,0,0,0,"0","Asia","MeansDifferences","PrePost",0,"6097","8","No","After",1,"Macro",532,"medium"

Gamification has recently been used to break habits and induce enduring behavior change. Building upon this work, we designed a new game-based sustainability intervention and tested its effectiveness in two large-scale field studies (total N = 1975). In Study 1, playing our new sustainability game significantly reduced people's household electricity consumption six months after the game. In Study 2, playing the game led to increased self reports of household efforts to save energy and perceived importance of sustainability. In both studies, high-energy consumers changed their environmental behaviors and attitudes the most. The research demonstrates that it is possible to induce a long-term change of habits in the sustainability domain. It also shows that neither attitude change nor conscious implementation intentions are necessary for behavior change. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

We compare consumption levels and patterns between a pilot group that received feedback in addition to smart metering devices and a control group with only smart metering devices. We investigate, in particular, the persistence of the effects and whether the effects differ between periods of high and low household occupancy, i.e. between morning and evening periods, and between weekdays and weekend days. The findings show that feedback is effective, leading to about 5% electricity consumption reduction that is persistent over an eleven month period. Furthermore, our results show that this reduction affects both low and high occupancy periods, suggesting that feedback is associated with rather permanent changes in habitual behavior and/or investments in energy-efficient technologies.",2017,NA,NA,"228",1,"Random effects regression","Annual HH electricity consumption","Control-treatment",0.055,-1,0.031,"Clustered at household level",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,283,NA,NA,599,NA,882,NA,NA,NA,NA,"3","t-test",1.774,"2",NA,NA,"Smart metering trial in Linz, Austria.

"23-311-1",NA,"Suter, JF; Shammin, MR",NA,2013,"Returns to residential energy efficiency and conservation measures: A field experiment","Residential energy conservation is a key component of contemporary energy, and climate change policy in the US and elsewhere. Comparisons of the relative effectiveness of measures aimed at reducing residential energy consumption are made challenging, however, by the endogeneity of technology and energy use decisions. In this paper we describe a novel small-scale field experiment that uses randomized treatments to estimate the returns to three types of energy conservation measures in institutionally owned homes. The results from the experiment indicate considerable reductions in natural gas consumption associated with the installation of attic insulation and the provision of incentives for conservation. The results are supported by observations of ambient indoor temperature data, which show that households receiving incentives significantly reduce their temperature settings especially when coupled with access to a programmable thermostat. The study will ideally provide guidance for institutions and communities considering energy efficiency measures and for future researchers designing randomized experiments to study residential energy use.

Comparisons of the relative effectiveness of measures aimed at reducing residential energy consumption are made challenging, however, by the endogeneity of technology and energy use decisions. In this paper we describe a novel small-scale field experiment that uses randomized treatments to estimate the returns to three types of energy conservation measures in institutionally owned homes. The results from the experiment indicate considerable reductions in natural gas consumption associated with the installation of attic insulation and the provision of incentives for conservation.

"23-312-1",NA,"Taylor, NW; Jones, PH; Kipp, MJ",NA,2014,"Targeting utility customers to improve energy savings from conservation and efficiency programs","Electric utilities, government agencies, and private interests in the US have committed and continue to invest substantial resources - including billions of dollars of financial capital - in the pursuit of energy efficiency and conservation through demand-side management (DSM) programs. While most of these programs are deemed to be cost effective, and therefore in the public interest, opportunities exist to improve cost effectiveness by targeting programs to those customers with the greatest potential for energy savings. This article details an analysis of three DSM programs offered by three Florida municipal electric utilities to explore such opportunities. First, we estimate programs' energy savings impacts; second, we measure and compare energy savings across subgroups of program participants as determined by their pre-intervention energy performance, and third, we explore potential changes in program impacts that might be realized by targeting specific customers for participation in the DSM programs. All three programs resulted in statistically significant average (per-participant) energy savings, yet average savings varied widely, with the customers who performed best (i.e., most efficient) before the intervention saving the least energy and those who performed worst (i.e., least efficient) before the intervention saving the most. Assessment of alternative program participation scenarios with varying levels of customer targeting suggests that program impacts could be increased by as much as 80% for a professional energy audit program, just over 100% for a high-efficiency heat pump upgrade program, and nearly 250% for an attic insulation upgrade program. Findings are directly relevant for utility program administrators seeking to improve program outcomes. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Half of the households in the experimental group were issued a notebook allowing them to compare their gas consumption with a self-set goal. The results revealed that households with a prepayment meter reduced their annual gas consumption by 4.1% compared with the control group; the notebook did not result in additional savings.

"23-322-1",NA,"Young, Robert M",NA,2014,"Variations on the normative feedback model for energy efficient behavior in the context of military family housing.","In discussions on energy efficiency, the topic often involves the development of a new technology. But models that target human behavior change can also generate significant energy savings, often with less expense. One such model that has been employed to millions of households across the United States is the normative feedback model. This model integrates the most salient research from the field of social norms into the utility billing process. Residents receive a home energy report that compares their energy consumption to the average energy consumption of their neighbors. Resulting behavior changes have led to energy savings of between 1.4% and 3.1% (Alcott, 2011). This research tests three variations of the normative feedback model, with the aim of determining its boundary conditions and improving it. Each variation aligns with one of the three research objectives: 1) to determine whether normative feedback generates significant energy savings when applied to households that are not billed for utility usage, 2) to determine whether increasing the proximity of comparison increases the energy savings generated by normative feedback, and 3) to determine energy savings associated with the implementation of a normative-based utility billing system. The first two variations were tested through an experiment conducted at Joint Base Andrews in Maryland, where residents are not currently billed for their utility usage. Residents received normative feedback via home energy reports for three consecutive months. Results were analyzed through both a differences-in-differences analysis and a multiple regression analysis, and an overall energy savings of 3.8% was identified. Thus, the normative feedback model can generate energy savings even in the absence of a billing system and could therefore be employed in the two-thirds of military family housing that are not yet billed for utilities, with resulting savings of approximately $19.3 million annually. In the home energy report experiment, residents were compared at three different levels of proximity: neighborhood, street, and next-door neighbor. The analysis identified an energy savings of 3.8% at the neighborhood level, 4.9% at the street level, and 2.8% at the next-door neighbor level. These results indicate a ""sweet spot"" in setting the proximity level of comparisons. By increasing the proximity from the neighborhood to the street level, energy savings increased, which is consistent with expectations based on a previous study in a different context (Goldstein, Cialdini, & Griskevicius, 2008). But increasing the proximity further to the next-door neighbor level actually reduced the energy savings. Therefore, to maximize effectiveness, future applications of normative feedback for energy efficiency should make comparisons at the street level of proximity. And finally, this research investigated the use of normative feedback as the basis for a utility billing system. Such a system, as implemented at Fort Belvoir in Virginia, establishes a monthly baseline equal to the average energy consumption for that month. Residents make payments for their consumption over the baseline and receive payments for their consumption under the baseline. A multiple regression analysis found that the implementation of this billing system into a community not previously billed for utility usage generated an energy savings of 14.1%. This result takes an important first step towards the development of a billing program optimization model for the military's transition to utility billing.

"23-322-6",NA,"Young, Robert M",NA,2014,"Variations on the normative feedback model for energy efficient behavior in the context of military family housing.","In discussions on energy efficiency, the topic often involves the development of a new technology. But models that target human behavior change can also generate significant energy savings, often with less expense. One such model that has been employed to millions of households across the United States is the normative feedback model. This model integrates the most salient research from the field of social norms into the utility billing process. Residents receive a home energy report that compares their energy consumption to the average energy consumption of their neighbors. Resulting behavior changes have led to energy savings of between 1.4% and 3.1% (Alcott, 2011). This research tests three variations of the normative feedback model, with the aim of determining its boundary conditions and improving it. Each variation aligns with one of the three research objectives: 1) to determine whether normative feedback generates significant energy savings when applied to households that are not billed for utility usage, 2) to determine whether increasing the proximity of comparison increases the energy savings generated by normative feedback, and 3) to determine energy savings associated with the implementation of a normative-based utility billing system. The first two variations were tested through an experiment conducted at Joint Base Andrews in Maryland, where residents are not currently billed for their utility usage. Residents received normative feedback via home energy reports for three consecutive months. Results were analyzed through both a differences-in-differences analysis and a multiple regression analysis, and an overall energy savings of 3.8% was identified. Thus, the normative feedback model can generate energy savings even in the absence of a billing system and could therefore be employed in the two-thirds of military family housing that are not yet billed for utilities, with resulting savings of approximately $19.3 million annually. In the home energy report experiment, residents were compared at three different levels of proximity: neighborhood, street, and next-door neighbor. The analysis identified an energy savings of 3.8% at the neighborhood level, 4.9% at the street level, and 2.8% at the next-door neighbor level. These results indicate a ""sweet spot"" in setting the proximity level of comparisons. By increasing the proximity from the neighborhood to the street level, energy savings increased, which is consistent with expectations based on a previous study in a different context (Goldstein, Cialdini, & Griskevicius, 2008). But increasing the proximity further to the next-door neighbor level actually reduced the energy savings. Therefore, to maximize effectiveness, future applications of normative feedback for energy efficiency should make comparisons at the street level of proximity. And finally, this research investigated the use of normative feedback as the basis for a utility billing system. Such a system, as implemented at Fort Belvoir in Virginia, establishes a monthly baseline equal to the average energy consumption for that month. Residents make payments for their consumption over the baseline and receive payments for their consumption under the baseline. A multiple regression analysis found that the implementation of this billing system into a community not previously billed for utility usage generated an energy savings of 14.1%. This result takes an important first step towards the development of a billing program optimization model for the military's transition to utility billing.

The article aims to identify the effectiveness and potential of smart meters and real-time IHDs in reducing Shanghai household energy consumption by affecting occupants’ behaviour. A general landscape of the occupant behaviour in residential buildings was briefly painted. A pilot study in Shanghai with an effective sample of 131 respondents was arranged into two groups as IHD and non-IHD households. A dedicated statistical analysis model was developed based on the micro-level empirical data to investigate the characteristics and the regulations of electricity consumption in these two groups, such as check frequency, electricity consumption reduction and shifting, energy bill saving, and standby power. The research results demonstrate that IHDs could lead to around 9.1% reduction in monthly electricity consumption and about 11.0% cut off in monthly electricity bills. A general comparison of the electricity consumption reduction between this research and the average UK case was further made. Barriers at current stage and challenges for further work were finally discussed. The statistical model is expected to ‘future proof’ smart meter and real-time displays through macro-level designing in modularity and flexibility in China. The overall research initially proves the concept of the feasible impact of smart meter and display technologies in the Chinese context, which is further expected to contribute to the empirical evidence on how IHD feedback could influence household electricity consumption in the Chinese context. © 2016, © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",2019,NA,NA,"14",1,"Difference of means","Household energy consumption","Control-treatment",NA,-1,NA,"-888",NA,NA,NA,NA,100.1,76,53.8,91,55,36.7,131,9.1,NA,47.39,NA,"1","t-test",NA,"1",NA,NA,"Everyone is under some sort of TOU tariff.; randomisation issue--",NA,NA,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,"City","China",NA,NA,NA,"China",NA,NA,"Yes","No",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"no","Energy (kWh)","inhomedisplay","continuous (on-demand)",0,0,0,NA,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,NA,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,NA,NA,NA,"multi",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"23-324",0.095572321677885,0.192023633677991,NA,0.192023633677991,0.0958649149496407,0.0075524253374514,NA,0.0075524253374514,0.0314804498495416,0.0078125,"Yes","No","No","Yes","No","No","Yes","No","Yes","No","Yes","Yes","Yes","Yes","No","Yes","Yes","No","3","3","3","3","3","randomised",0,0,0,0,0,0,"0","Asia","MeansDifferences","Control-treatment",1,NA,NA,"Yes","After",1,"Macro",631,"high"

"23-233-1",NA,"Egel, K.",NA,1987,"Evaluation of an Alternative Home Energy Audit Program","From May 1984 through May 1985 the city of Santa Monica, California, operated an innovative home energy audit program designed to test alternative approaches to the federally mandated Residential Conservation Service (RCS) Program, the program under which virtually all major utility companies in the nation have offered their customers energy conservation audits and recommendations since the early 1980s. As a consequence of the Energy Fitness Program's unique approach, it has become one of the nation's most successful home energy audit programs. This article provides a brief summary of the unique elements of the Santa Monica Program's approach, describes the components of the experimental design by which the effort was completed, and presents the final results of the evaluation performed to measure the program's effectiveness. The evaluation discus sion will particularly focus on program participation and net savings in natural gas, electricity, and water resources achieved by participants. © 1987, Sage Publications.

In a pretest-posttest design, an empirical study tested whether change in attitude, knowledge, engagement and behaviour with respect to energy conservation in the household was different for participants playing Powersaver Game compared to a control condition where participants used an energy dashboard with the same content, but excluding game features. The aim of this game (developed using an iterative user-centered game design methodology) is to influence household energy consumption by means of electricity and gas usage in the long-term. The intervention time was at least 5 weeks and pre and post measures based on 21 days intervals. All energy conservation activities that the application provides (e.g. washing clothes on low temperatures) take place in the real world and feedback is based on real time energy consumption. This inverse gamification principle aims to optimize the transfer between the game world and the real world. Energy consumption significantly changed in the game condition compared to the control condition, and the difference between both conditions is more than 33% after the intervention. In the game condition, knowledge about energy conservation was significantly increased, although no significant differences in increase of attitude and engagement were found. We conclude that Powersaver Game is effective in transfer of energy conservation knowledge, which leads to energy saving behaviour on the long term. It cannot be concluded that playing the game leads to a greater change in attitude, however, attitude scores of the participants were high from the start. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",2019,NA,NA,"263",1,"Difference of means","Percent reduction in energy consumption","Difference in Difference",NA,-1,NA,"-999",NA,NA,NA,33.6,-12.2,5,18.5,21.4,6,7.7,11,33.6,NA,13.60330842,NA,"1","t-test",NA,"1",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,"-999","Netherlands",NA,NA,NA,"Netherlands","Household level randomization",NA,"Yes","Yes",NA,NA,NA,"6","3",NA,"no","NA",NA,"NA",0,0,0,NA,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,NA,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,NA,NA,NA,"single",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"23-237",0.777170018492283,2.46998737091047,NA,2.46998737091047,1.03818421746401,0.015682135583224,NA,0.015682135583224,0.643977467232903,0.125,"Yes","No","No","No","No","No","No","Yes","Yes","No","Yes","No","No","No","No","No","No","Yes","3","2","3","1","1","household",0,0,0,0,0,0,"0","Europe excl.

About half of these households received feedback together with information about electricity-saving measures (pilot group), while the remaining households served as a control group. Participation in the pilot group was random, but households were able to choose between two types of feedback: access to a web portal or written feedback by post. Results from cross section OLS regression suggest that feedback provided to the pilot group corresponds with electricity savings of around 4.5% for the average household. Our results from quantile regressions imply that for households in the 30th to the 70th percentile of electricity consumption, feedback on electricity consumption is statistically significant and effects are highest in absolute terms and as a share of electricity consumption. For percentiles below or above this range, feedback appears to have no effect. Finally, controlling for a potential endogeneity bias induced by non random participation in the feedback type groups, we find no difference in the effects of feedback provided via the web portal and by post.

Theoretical mechanisms and empirical evidence","China’s carbon inclusion policy (CIP) is an innovative voluntary emission reduction mechanism that aims to drive consumption-side emission reductions and achieve dual carbon goals. However, the effectiveness of the policy has not yet been assessed. To fill this research gap, this study evaluated the impact of CIP on urban household carbon emissions based on panel data from 283 cities in China from 2006 to 2020. This was conducted using staggered difference-in-differences (DID), synthetic DID, and spatial DID methods. The results showed that the CIP significantly reduced household carbon emissions through the green consumption awareness enhancing effect and green supply capacity improving effect. Heterogeneity tests indicated that carbon reduction effects are stronger in electricity and gas consumption and relatively modest in the heating and transportation domains. Cities with higher financial technology levels and greater government intervention had better policy outcomes. CIP also exhibited spatial spillover effects on household carbon emissions and synergistically reduced air pollution. Despite incurring certain economic costs, it ultimately promoted regional economic growth.

Adopting the AMI was randomly assigned by the Korean Government. However, the adoption timing varies across household, making it difficult to apply an ordinary difference-in-difference (DID) approach to measure the impact, given the variation in adoption timing across households. We use a dynamic DID that is suitable for estimating a causal effect of a policy whose treatment timing differs depending upon the individual. Results indicate that AMI adoption led to a reduction in household electricity consumption, peaking within 18 months after adoption with a slight rebound effect. Our findings suggest that providing information on energy consumption and cost in the household sector can significantly reduce electricity use by as much as one quarter of average monthly consumption.

To motivate residents to adopt more sustainable behaviours, user interfaces on smartphones and laptops are increasingly using consumption data from households' smart meters to enable effective goal-setting. In contrast to previous research largely focusing on goal-setting in isolation, this study examines the role of specific social comparison-related design features that future research and practitioners can consider along with goal-setting to stimulate sustainable behaviours. Specifically, we look into the influence of residents' perception of their relative performance (i.e., whether their behaviour was better or worse than a reference group) on their ambition to act (i.e., targeted inprovement goal) and their actual energy consumption behaviour. Moreover, we investigate the influence of a goal's evaluative standard (i.e., whether the goal refers to one's own or other's perforrmance) on the relationship between relative performance, ambition to act, and energy consumption behaviour. Drawing on social consumption theory, we conducted a framed field experiment with 152 households. We find that a goal's evaluative standard influences resident's awareness of their relative performance, affecting their ambition to act and, ultimately, their energy consumption behaviour. More specifically, we find that whereas other- (vs. self-) referencing goals encourage residents from worse-than-average performing households more strongly to improve their energy consumption behaviour, they discourage better-than-average ones. Overall, our study provides novel insights into the interplay between relative performance and evaluative standards as a means of fostering social comparison in smart meter-facilitated goal-setting, highlighting their crucial role in effectively supporting sustainable behaviours.",2024,"NA","NA","17",1,"OLS regression","Others","Control-treatment",10.46,-1,3,"standard error","The dependent variable is heating intensity reduction.

An information framework aimed at normalization can do well in motivating individuals’ energy-saving behaviors. To assess the effectiveness of normative information intervention strategies in motivating college students to save energy, this study innovatively adopts a new method combining traditional influence path analysis and field experiment, which makes up for the shortcomings of the traditional single questionnaire survey method. First, this study introduced “normative information” and “personal norms” into the theory of planned behavior (TPB). The aim was to explore the mechanisms by which the provision of normative information affects college students’ energy-saving intentions through a questionnaire (352 questionnaires). Then, on this basis, a field experiment was conducted in 70 university dormitories with 313 students to further assess the effectiveness of four normative information intervention strategies in promoting energy-saving behaviors. The study results showed: 1) Attitude, perceived behavioral control, subjective norms, and personal norms were significantly correlated with energy saving intentions. 2) Positive normative feedback and low-intensity normative feedback had significant positive effects on personal norms, which fully mediated the relationships between positive/low-intensity normative feedback and energy-saving intentions. 3) Positive low-intensity normative information achieved the best energy-saving effect (with an energy-saving ratio of 29.18%), followed by positive high-intensity normative information (24.97%) and negative low-intensity normative information (24.38%).

To address this issue, mixed normative feedback strategies have been proposed as a potential solution for achieving more effective and lasting energy savings. However, the effectiveness of these strategies can vary significantly depending on the combinatory choices and social contexts in which they are implemented. Despite the potential benefits of mixed normative feedback strategies, it is currently unclear which mixed normative feedback strategies can effectively and sustainably promote energy conservation among residents in shared spaces. To address this gap, this study designed three mixed normative feedback strategies and conducted a 28-week field-controlled experiment to assess their effectiveness in motivating residents in shared dorms to save electricity. The Difference-in-Difference analysis was employed to evaluate their effectiveness. The results showed that the strategy mixing normative feedback with group-contrast feedback exhibited the greatest energy savings, with an average of 12.93 % after 5 weeks and 8.75 % after 12 weeks. The strategy combining normative feedback and instruction-based information failed to generate significant energy savings in the short term, but the inclusion of self-contrast feedback resulted in a significant 7.73 % reduction in energy consumption.

The paper finds evidence for salience cycles of heating bills that last up to 4 months, likely because consumer attention to heat energy costs is short-lived and absent during months when heating is off. Importantly, this phenomena is pervasive enough to be detectable even in aggregated building-level consumption data. Results suggest that the mere knowledge of costs is not sufficient and that the response to billing information also hinges on its time varying salience. These findings underscore the importance of understanding the dynamic and heterogeneous nature of cost salience in the design of effective billing for energy conservation.",2024,"NA","NA","7",5,"OLS regression","Others","Control-treatment",0.049,1,0.011,"standard error","The dependent variable is natural log of annual energy units consumed (kWh) per sqm for space heating by building i during the billing period that started in year t.

In the Republic of Georgia, in April 2020 the government announced that it would pay the electricity bills of residential customers in April and May 2020, effectively making electricity free, as long as usage would not exceed 200 kWh/month. Consumers using more than 200 kWh would pay the regular tariff on the entire consumption (not just the kWh above 200). In August 2020, the government announced that the policy would be in force again in November and December 2020, and January and February 2021. We examine meter readings from a 10 % sample of the country's customers base outside of the Tbilisi city limits to see if the response to the policy is consistent with the predictions from economic theory. We find that, as suggested by economic theory, in the months when the policy is in place low-volume consumers increase their electricity usage and high-volume consumers decrease it in an effort to make the 200 kWh mark. However, we do not find any evidence of â€œbunchingâ€ at 200 kWh or of a â€œholeâ€ thereafter. The average household increased usage by some 5 % above and beyond their normal. This figure however masks considerable heterogeneity in the effects of the policy across urban, rural, and â€œhigh mountainâ€ status areas.

Evidence from a one-year quasi-experiment in Switzerland","App-based interventions are increasingly used to foster energy-sufficient household routines. Previous studies rarely measure whether the effect persists in the long-term, and for the few that have, the savings effects â€“ often estimated without a control group â€“ are not maintained over time. To favour long-lasting effects, we posit that (i) app users should be engaged in the app design, (ii) apps should focus on collective-level features that support community building (rather than individual-level consumption feedback only), and (iii) specific app features are needed in the long-term to resist relapse. We assess the overall effect of these strategies in the â€œSocial Power Plus Community Energy Challengeâ€, an app-based intervention run in 2022 in Switzerland involving about 200 voluntary households. Quasi-experimental estimates under a weighted Difference-in-Differences approach show that on average the intervention produced nearly 5% energy savings over one full year. However, the effect was higher in the first quarter (up to 11% energy saving), becoming negligible in the last quarters. We reflect on how the three strategies did not ensure long-term effects and recommend future research to further explore the potential of community-based processes, focusing less on apps and more on collectively questioning dominant social norms around household routines.

Moreover, they strengthened economic incentives for gas conservation. In fact, a substantial amount of natural gas was saved during the winter of 2022/23. This raises the question to what extent this success is attributable to government and corporate means to foster energy conservation in the crisis, including energy policies such as the German governmentâ€™s â€œgas price brake,â€ gas-saving programs launched by public utilities, and consumersâ€™ individual pricing schemes. We analyzed the effectiveness of these means using a survey and a field experiment with a German gas supplier and show that, while household savings during the crisis were substantial, economic incentives did not significantly change behavior. Indeed, demand for gas is largely price inelastic. A large majority of consumers do not understand the incentives arising from the gas price brake, and when they do, they do not respond. Likewise, consumers do not react to the design of the utilitiesâ€™ gas-saving program. These findings suggest that i) citizensâ€™ response to marginal individual economic incentives contributes little to overall gas savings, and ii) the crisis, along with the extensive societal engagement it generated, likely shifted the publicâ€™s mindset about energy consumption, making conservation a social priority.

These findings suggest that i) citizensâ€™ response to marginal individual economic incentives contributes little to overall gas savings, and ii) the crisis, along with the extensive societal engagement it generated, likely shifted the publicâ€™s mindset about energy consumption, making conservation a social priority.
